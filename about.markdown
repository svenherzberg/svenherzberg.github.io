# Hi! I'm Sven Herzberg

I'm a passionate development expert at SAP, specializing in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, and cutting-edge software development. My technical toolkit spans Python, ABAP OO, SAP HANA, Fiori/SAPUI5, JavaScript, and Quantum Programming.

I architect and build innovative solutions that drive business value and empower teams. My work is fueled by curiosity for emerging technologies and a hands-on approach to learning and problem solving.

Beyond my professional life, I thrive on creativity and adventureâ€”whether it's improv theatre, sports, hiking, cooking, or baking. I believe that diverse experiences spark new ideas and help me deliver impactful results.

Let's shape the future together!
