Do you want to learn a new topic quickly and already have resources like a book at hand?  
Upload your learning materials and start an engaging discussion with your smart companion. You can have fruitful conversations about the topic, practice speaking about it, and ask your companion to challenge you with questions.

This approach enables you to learn more efficiently through active learning.

The Smart Learning Companion is a graph RAG based tool featuring both text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) capabilities.
