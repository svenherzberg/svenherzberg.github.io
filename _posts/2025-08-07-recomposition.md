# Body Recomposition
Body recomposition is the process of simultaneously losing fat and gaining muscle. Unlike traditional methods that focus solely on weight loss or muscle gain, recomposition emphasizes improving your body’s composition—reducing body fat percentage while increasing lean muscle mass. Achieving body recomposition typically involves a combination of resistance training, adequate protein intake, and a balanced calorie approach. Progress can be gradual, but with consistency and proper nutrition, you can achieve significant changes in both your physique and overall health.

That’s the definition—so why am I talking about this?

It all started after the Covid pandemic, during a wonderful vacation on the beautiful island of Crete in 2023. We spent our days relaxing on the beach, soaking up the sun, enjoying local drinks, and exploring the island. On one of our outings, we took a group photo. Later, when we looked at the pictures, we had a bit of a shock: we looked less like our ideal selves and more like a group of penguins (no offense to those charming animals!). If we had laid down on the beach, we joked, animal rescuers might have tried to roll us back into the sea.

That was my wake-up call.

Losing weight and building muscle is tough. There’s a lot of so-called “common knowledge” about it, and endless advice on how to get it done. Not all of it is consistent, and not everything is backed by science—or even true. Some scientific studies even contradict each other or can’t be reproduced, sometimes due to small sample sizes or different conditions. Even when you know what to do, following through is still difficult. Our bodies are designed to survive, even when food is scarce, making fat loss a challenge.

Ultimately, it comes down to tracking calories and doing strength training.

There’s a wealth of great information out there on both topics. When it comes to strength training, I especially appreciate Jeff Nippard’s work. He takes a science-based approach, tests training methods, and shares his findings through books and online content. You can find his resources on [his website](https://jeffnippard.com/) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffNippard).

When it comes to calorie tracking, I follow recipes from a popular German TV series on NDR called “Die Ernährungs-Docs.” Their [website](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/die-ernaehrungsdocs) features over 600 nutritious and healthy recipes, categorized for different health goals and dietary needs. Their books are also excellent resources, providing deeper insights into weight loss and using food to combat various illnesses.

To help with meal planning, I created a small tool to build my own recipe collection and plan weekly meals. This tool ensures you stay within your selected macronutrient targets and makes it easy to combine recipes from various sources. 

You can find more information about this on the project page for the [Food Balancer]({% post_url 2025-07-05-foodbalancer %}) .

However, none of this information matters unless you put it into practice.
