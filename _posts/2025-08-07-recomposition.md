# Body Recomposition
Body recomposition refers to the process of simultaneously losing fat and gaining muscle. Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on weight loss or muscle gain, recomposition emphasizes improving body compositionâ€”reducing body fat percentage while increasing lean muscle mass. This process typically involves a combination of resistance training, adequate protein intake, and a balanced calorie approach. Progress may be gradual, but with consistency and proper nutrition, significant changes in physique and overall health can be achieved.
