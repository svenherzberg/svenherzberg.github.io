In 2023, I finally gathered and refined all the family recipes I had collected from my grandma over the years of cooking together. Compiling these into a book was an incredible effort—despite already having many recipes jotted down in notebooks and committed to memory. It took several months to write the manuscript, print a test version, ask friends to proofread and provide feedback, and navigate the entire printing process.

For the layout, I used Affinity Publisher—a fantastic one-time purchase software that I much prefer over subscription-based alternatives like Adobe. It allowed me to create a professional-looking book without ongoing fees.

The finished cookbook turned out perfectly, and I was able to present it as a Christmas gift in 2024.

The book features a wide range of recipes, including soups, baked goods, Christmas specialties, cakes, cookies, and classic German dishes. My grandma comes from a long line of traditional bakers, and I’ve learned so much from her. This book is a tribute to her knowledge and the influence she’s had on my cooking and baking.

Some photos of the recipes are shown below.
