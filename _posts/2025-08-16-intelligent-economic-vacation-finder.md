I'm quite flexible when it comes to vacationsâ€”I have many destinations in mind, along with ideas about how long I'd like to stay and roughly when I'd like to travel. Sometimes, I'm even completely open about the dates, but I do have a few favorite airlines I prefer.

The Thrifty TripAdvisor searches my preferred airlines based on my preferences and restrictions, such as trip duration, travel period, and budget. It then finds the best available options for me and can either book a flight automatically or notify me so I can book it myself.
